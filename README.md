# Meteor todo list

Taking my first steps in [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) by following [this tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) to build a **todo app**.

## Run the app

```bash
cd meteor-todo-list
meteor
```

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.
